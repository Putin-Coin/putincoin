// An iterator yields a sequence of key/value pairs from a source.
// The following class defines the interface.  Multiple implementations
// are provided by this library.  In particular, iterators are provided
// to access the contents of a Table or a DB.
//
// Multiple threads can invoke const methods on an Iterator without
// external synchronization, but if any of the threads may call a
// non-const method, all threads accessing the same Iterator must use
// external synchronization.
